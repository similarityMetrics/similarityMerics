# Semantic Similarity Metrics for Evaluating Source Code Summarization
This repository contains code and data for calculating semantic similarity metrics for evaluating source code summarization. This project is aimed to demonstrate the empirical and statistical evidence that bleu score does not correlate between similarity between reference and autmatically generated comments. It also provides a script for computing cosine similarity score using universal sentence encoder on the comment pairs.

## Dependencies
